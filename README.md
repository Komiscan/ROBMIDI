(LMAO Yes, this is stolen from google. I'm lazy asfuck to create my own)

## Installation
1. Click this -> If you are lazy to go to release page [RobMIDI.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18351353/RobMIDI.zip](https://github.com/Komiscan/ROBMIDI/releases/download/1.0/RobMIDI.zip)
2. Extract them
3. Convert a MiDi file first.
4. Configure song.txt. Configure the Tempo however you like, but do not make some changes on notes unless you know what you are doing. I only recommend the Tempo
5. then run runMacro.exe

## Usage
The use for this program is for entertainment. I don't really care whether you use it to cheat on piano servers or something, go do whatever you want
